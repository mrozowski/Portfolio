            <h2>Databases</h2>
            <p> With databases, I’m familiar since high school. At college, I started using it more often eg. for my desktop application or for websites project. I used mostly <b>MySQL</b>. During college, I had an <b>internship</b> in the <b>Statistical Office in Lublin</b> were worked with <b>MS SQL</b>. However, recently I also started using <b>NoSQL</b> databases such as <b>Firebase</b> for my Android <a href="https://github.com/mrozowski/Android-Social-Media-App" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> . It’s a social media app for posting short articles. This project gives me the opportunity to learn more about <b>non-relational databases</b>.</p>
