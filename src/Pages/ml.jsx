            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is something that inspires me so much. This technology change so quickly that it’s hard to predict what we will have in 10 years. My <b>bachelor thesis</b> was about <b>genetic algorithms</b>. I wrote a program in <b>Python</b> that uses that algorithm to find the shortest way to the goal and concurrently avoiding obstacles. Thanks to this thesis I’ve learned a lot about genetic algorithms, principles of artificial intelligence, and data visualization. My <b>master thesis</b> topic is also related to artificial intelligence. This time more with analyzing data - <b>data mining</b> and prediction models. </p>  
            <p>I’m studying on my own, trying every day to read and write a little bit of code. Machine learning is very difficult but maybe that's why it's so <b>fulfilling</b>. I really <b>enjoy</b> spending time with it and learn more about how it works and how it can be used to <b>help people</b>.  </p>          
            <p>What I have wrote and learned already you can check <a href="https://github.com/mrozowski/MachineLearning-jupyter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I upload there <b>Jupyter notebooks</b> files with my code related to <b>analizing data</b>, <b>data visualization</b> and <b>predictions models</b>.</p>
