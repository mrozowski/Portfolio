            <p>Art is something I love since. I was <b>drawing</b> often and everyone at school liked my work. I think the <b>passion</b> for drawing came from my dad and brother who also has a talent for drawing. From drawing on paper I went to drawing on a computer where I found there are so many tools and jobs where graphic skills are very useful. Due to <b>curiosity</b> and analytical thinking, I started studying the <b>theory of colors</b>. What colors suit each other. How to choose a color <b>palette</b>. Also how to place objects in the layout so it is pleasant for the eye. The theory behind the art is so enormous that itâ€™s impossible to learn all of it - we can just try to feel it...</p>
