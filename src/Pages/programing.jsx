            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>I started programming in high school. And because I like to create things that can <b>help people</b> I got really like that profession where I can create programs, solutions that help people in everyday living. When I work on my project I like to think through, understand what functionality Iâ€™ll need. I design UI and then I start working with code. Thanks to that when I start coding I already know the idea of the project and how more-less my code should look. So in the end I spend less time making changes in the code.</p>
            <p>Most of my free time I spend learning programming. Recently mostly <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>data analysis</b> because in the future I'd love to become a <b>machine learning engineer</b>.</p>
